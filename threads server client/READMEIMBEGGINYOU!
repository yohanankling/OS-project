the file description:
server.c - server run by threads
client.c - client code form https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#a-simple-stream-server
originalServer.c - original server code run by forks, taken from https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#a-simple-stream-server

so here is few steps to run the program :

1: run the make file with command "make all"

2: run server file by command "./server"

3: run client file by command "./client 127.0.0.1"

(that adress is for an example to ubuntu user, that represent the local ip)
