the file description:
server.cpp - server run by process
client.cpp - client code form https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#a-simple-stream-server
makefile - makefile with all and clean command
stack.cpp - implementation of a stack with PUSH POP TOP function, malloc and free implementation.
stack implementation is from https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/cpp/stack+using+linked+list+in+c%2B%2B
stack.hpp - h file for the stuck
test.cpp - a test file the play client1
test2.cpp - a test file the play client2

so here is few steps to run the program :

1: run the make file with command "make all"

2: run server file by command "./server"

3: run client file by command "./client 127.0.0.1"
(that adress is for an example to ubuntu user, that represent the local ip)
you can repeat step 3 several (10) times..

4: follow the command menu that printed to the screen (PUSH, POP, TOP, QUIT functions)

5: use as you want the stack.

6: when you finish you can use "make clean" command to erase 'junk' files.


how to run the test:

1: run the make file with command "make all"

2: run server file by command "./server"

3: run test1 file by command "./test1 127.0.0.1"

                 IMPORTANT!!!
you need to run step 4 in 7 second for the test
because we used 7 second sleep function to show how 
2 different clients uses the same stack.(you can increase sleep function to more seconds if you want..)

4: run test2 file by command "./test2 127.0.0.1"

5: read the output explain of what the tests tested exaclly.
